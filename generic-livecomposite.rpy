  #Get Character Indexes
  #
  #This function defines the format of all images to be used.
  #There are multiple parameters which need to be set, which will affect how
  #images are processed and stacked.
  #
  #The two main types of indexes are defined by the 'nested' parameter:
  #
  #If nested is False, the values are simple, plain, generic images.
  #The index is a directory, and anything within will be used as a layer.
  #
  #If nested is True, two-level directories are used.
  #The index is a directory, but instead of having images within this directory,
  #there will be further directories, and in THOSE directories are the images to be used.
  #
  #eg.
  #expressions/smile.png
  #poses/arms_crossed/shirt.png
  #poses/hand_behind_head/shirt.png
  #
  #In the above examples, 'expressions' would be an example of a simple layer.
  #'expressions' is the directory, 'smile.png' is an image within that directory.
  #'poses' would be a nested layer. The directories within 'poses' each contain images
  #of their own (outfits, in this case), in addition to one image defined by 'file_name'.
  #
  #Nested indexes are used when common layers need to match, yet come in variations.
  #For example, let's say we have the following files:
  #poses/arms_crossed/pose.png
  #poses/arms_crossed/shirt.png
  #poses/arms_crossed/dress.png
  #poses/hand_behind_head/pose.png
  #poses/hand_behind_head/shirt.png
  #poses/hand_behind_head/dress.png
  #
  #Since poses defines a 'file_name' parameter of 'pose', the 'pose.png' files are
  #used as the base image for each pose. They are displayed above the outfits (since
  #innerAbove is set to False).
  #The other images (shirt, dress), however, are different outfits, which need to be
  #paired with the appropriate pose.
  #So in this case, arms_crossed/pose.png is shown on top of arms_crossed/shirt.png,
  #hand_behind_head/pose.png is shown on top of hand_behind_head/dress.png, and so on.
  #
  #With an expression of 'smile' and a character 'sara', the end result would be the images:
  #sara arms_crossed shirt
  #sara arms_crossed dress
  #sara hand_behind_head shirt
  #sara hand_behind_head dress
  #
  #
  ###PARAMETERS###
  #
  #level: defined the order in which layers are arranged.
  #For example, poses has a level of 2, so it would be lower than expressions.
  #Expressions has a level of 3, so it would be below outfits_extra.
  #So in this case, it would be BaseSprite -> Poses -> Outfits -> Expressions -> OutfitsExtra
  #
  #toggle: if True, the layer becomes optional.
  #eg. You could have both "sara arms_crossed shirt apron" and "sara arms_crossed shirt" defined.
  #Toggleable layers are typically optional extras shown on top of other layers, but which may not
  #always be desireable.
  #
  #nested: explained above.
  #
  #file_name: for 'nested' only.
  #If left out, file_name defaults to the name of the directory.
  #This parameter is used to define an image within nested directories to be shown across
  #all variations of that layer.
  #An example of this was given above, where 'pose' was the file_name.
  #'pose.png' was then required for each inner directory, and shown above or below the other
  #files in that directory.
  #
  #innerAbove: for 'nested' only.
  #Defaults to: False
  #If True, the contents of a nested directory are displayed above the file_name image.
  #If False, the contents are displayed below the file_name image.
  #
  #
  #
  ###HOW TO USE###
  #
  #In an init python block (you can put it in this file, for example), you need to include
  #a line such as: define_characters('sprites/')
  #That would tell the script to go into the 'sprites' directory, and search every folder within.
  #
  #eg. sprites/sara, sprites/misa, etc.
  #Would define a character of sara, a character of misa, and so on.
  #
  #Inside each character folder, you will need to create the directories specified by this method.
  #eg. sprites/sara/expressions
  #
  #Finally, inside the directories, put the images you desire.

  #characterImageFolder: folder to search for characters.

  #For character sprites, this simulates a character facing the other way.
  #
  #side: either false, or a tuple of (x, y).
  #A side image would be a small image to be displayed in the textbox; NOT a character sprite.
  #If the value is a size tuple, the side image will be cropped from the top left
  #of the full image, for a total size of x, y.
  #
  #toWrite: if true, the definitions are written to file.

  #then move the generated rpy file into your game's folder and comment out your
  #define_characters methods.
  #ie. Run this method once with toWrite enabled, so you don't need to run this
