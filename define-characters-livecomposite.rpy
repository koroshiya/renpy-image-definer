  ###
  #In this script, there's a set format in which images should be stored.
  #This script is specifically designed for characters, and the images themselves
  #are expected to be in a specific format.
  #
  #Images should be exported to multiple different layers.
  #eg. A layer for the base sprite, one for the outfit, one for the pose, one for the expression.
  #There's a bit of leeway here. At a minimum, you could have a base sprite with expressions.
  #
  #The structure is as follows:
  #-A directory for sprites
  #-Separate character directories within that directory
  #
  #After that, the format can shift a bit. For example, a very basic character could include:
  #-A base.png file (the sprite itself) in the character directory
  #-An "expressions" folder within the character directory
  #-Multiple expression files within the "expressions" folder.
  #
  #Another possible format would be:
  #-A poses folder, containing a folder for each pose
  #-Within each of those folders, a "pose.png" file for the base sprite, and other images (eg. uniform.png)
  #   for each outfit
  #-Once again, an expressions folder containing each expression

  #Example usage:
  #
  #Directories:
  #/game/sprites/
  #              sara/
  #                   expressions/
  #                               happy.png
  #                   poses/arms_crossed/
  #                                      pose.png
  #                                      uniform.png
  #                   base.png
  #
  #If we then ran:
  #define_characters("sprites/")
  #we would be able to call:
  #show sara uniform arms_crossed happy
  #and
  #show sara flip uniform arms_crossed happy
  #
  #I could also add the directory and image:
  #/game/sprites/sara/outfits_extra/apron.png
  #After which I could call:
  #show sara uniform apron arms_crossed happy
  #
  #What happens is, the images found in the path are combined using LiveComposite, and the definition is defined
  #based on the path to the image.
  #So, for example, base.png is on the bottom, then the uniform is added to it, then the pose, then the expression.
  #The result is a complete sprite created dynamically.
